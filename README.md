# WineRecommender

Using the wine reviews data set from Kaggle with 130K+ reviews, I tried to build out a recommendation system to find the right wine for my sister. 

Starting with a handful of wines that I know that she likes, I extracted the common characteristics, words, and word frequencies to narrow the list down to ~60 wines, then applied a series of additional filters to get the values down to just 2 final wines.
